title: Hello, World
summary: You always need to start somewhere.

It’s always a little cheesy to start a project off with this title, but there’s something very comforting about putting the first splash of words, like scribbling all over the front of a journal. It’s already messed up, so it’s time to begin.

I’m in the process of trying to get this repo outfitted with enough power and flexibility so I can begin documenting my thesis process thus far. Back in the spring, our Thesis Prep class helped get us in the mindset of what’s important to think about when choosing a thesis topic. Now, on the verge of the fall semester, it’s time to get down to the business of that choosing.

I’ve let my thoughts languish between slips of index cards, a few Field Notes notebooks and a bunch of drafts sitting in various places, cloud-based or otherwise. This is where they’ll start to come together, and you can expect that over the coming days.

This is a complete work in progress, and it needs love, so feel free to either [file an issue][issue] or reach out to me on [Twitter][]. I’m nervous, but excited to begin.
