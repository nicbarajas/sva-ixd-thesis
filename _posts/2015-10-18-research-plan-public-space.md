title: "Research: Community Food Space"
summary: Coming up with ideas for an experimental community place.
---

A feeling that keeps waving over me, as I go through both the streets of the city as well as those of small communities (at least in America), is that we’ve got a ton of space that we’re willing to do nothing with for way too long. And at the same time, not enough publicly facing space that allows people to experiment without getting overly invested.

If we know that half of all businesses fail to survive past five years, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics (via the [U.S. Small Business Administration][sba]), what tools could be given to burgeoning entrepreneurs without requiring huge fixed costs like rent and labor?

## Here to date

Originally, I’d been calling this a public space project, which was confusing, because the name evokes the use of publicly owned space like parks, or [privately owned public spaces][pops], of which my idea is neither.

Instead, the idea is to make private space actually owned by the public in a more meaningful way. POPS don’t seem to fit the bill because they are meant for the public to enjoy, but not for their improvement.

A few aspects to this plan:

- My goal is focused on chefs, cooks, and people who work in the foodservice industry. Why? They are the ones who are the least likely to have the benefits of investment and retail opportunity.
- My focus is on community, and my aim is to try to find a way to make it meaningful. Community often has been spun with emptiness, and it may appear on the surface to look more like patrons or customers than people who can interact, but

## In this space, current, former and nearby

There are a bunch of other people who are doing things that are near and dear to that idea, but not necessarily the same.

- As a recent historical example, [The Walk-In Cookbook][twic] was a business in Park Slope that tried to perform a local, [Blue Apron][]-like experience. It closed a couple of years ago, but I am very curious about what happened with it.

## Where I’m headed

I’m still gathering information from folks about what’s good here. So more TK, obviously. I had a great conversation with a friend who’s working on dining projects down in Richmond, Virginia, such as [Longoven][] ([Instagram][longoven IG]), but has also talked about what he wantes to do with more community outreach down there. A different friend pointed me to the [Museum of Food and Drink][mofad], which sounds like a fascinating foray into the subject.
