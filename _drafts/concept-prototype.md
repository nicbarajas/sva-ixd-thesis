summary: "Thesis has shifted to a prototype and testing phase, but life has slightly different plans for me."

Funny thing that life.

As I was preparing late last week to really buckle down on thesis, life decided it would be more fun to throw me a curveball.

[So that happened.][curveball]

And now, a few days later, I’m giving myself a chance to reflect on what happened and move forward with what’s more important—and then, actually focusing on thesis.

## Getting Over the Stuff Stuff

Since having my own version of Christina Xu’s “[The Life-Changing Magic of Losing Shit][xu-stuff],” I’ve gotten to reflect on a few important aspects of what I’ve lost, and what I’ve ironically gained (not stuff).

- *Turns out, good backups are important.* One device was about three weeks out of regular backup rotation, owing to a recent upgrade. Never made the time to get it back up to speed, and it hurt. But everything else has been backed up in the last week at the latest. And my camera is the real disappointment—without a reliable pipe out, I delayed on getting things off there.
- *… but not as important as the cloud.* I had a couple of weird blips with Google Drive, but generally everything has kept on trucking with almost no delay. If you live your life in the cloud—and most knowledge workers do—your devices could take a bath on a weekly basis without much harm.
    Personally, I want no such thing, but to know that salvation is a pretty near prospect with problems only as big as the inverse of the pipe to your next device.
- *Habits are difficult.* I should have made a go at using a replacement in a pretty stock configuration to see what I needed, but the cost of that was so high I did a much better job of wasting hours getting a restore done “properly,” inasmuch as a stupid three-week-old backup can be.
    But were a version of this to happen again, I’m already planning my escape. I’m taking this from the opposite of Christina—it’s time to begin my path down the KonMari method. More deliberate choices were things I began to think more strongly just before my bag grew legs—and now I have little excuse not to spend a minute reflecting over more of what I can absolutely do without.
- *Making my workflow device-agnostic is a huge win.* Friends, or at least classmates, know me as the iPad guy in the class. I avoided a full computer as much as I was able, to great success in some areas.
    And overall, it’s made me about 80% pleased with my early choice to have my thesis on GitHub. From a workflow perspective, re-establishing a means of adding posts and updating has literally meant me cramming my face into my iPhone—90% of what I’ve written lately has been with my two thumbs. (N.B., when it rains it pours: My screen developed a bright spot and I found myself at the Genius Bar this week to have the thing replaced.)

But it has highlighted other deficiencies with my current storytelling:

- I don’t usually have artwork in my posts, and having a smaller screen did not help;
- organizing files in this setup is a tedious affair, from draft to completion;
- my ideas to use Jekyll as a means of creating a greater organizational structure around tagging and projects has already hit the fan; and
- sketching went analog again. Not that this last part is much a problem, but it’s a trickier workflow to incorporate any image file that doesn’t live its life in an easy-to-reference place. (GitHub is pretty awful for images, I feel.)

Funny enough, it got me to write this meta piece I had planned for a while. A lot of the commentary in my mind
