“A Huge Mess of Links” is going to be my attempt to clear out a boatload of tabs that are sitting on my various devices. I think this is going to be particularly interesting, and I might make it a series of posts instead of one huge dump.

## Random Dump of stuff

No idea when this came to me, but “Why I Quit Ordering From Uber-for-Food Start-Ups” http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/the-food-delivery-start-up-you-havent-heard-of/414540/

 Om: What do you make of the whole internet of things and all these connected devices?

Erik: There’s a great promise as much as a threat. For me, the great promise is that a lot of things that are not happening in this country and other countries — for example, transport. People get stuck in two hours of traffic jams and stuff; it’s horrible. One guy sitting in a car crossing the bridge is stupid. It could be four people in there, right? And the same goes for buildings. The same goes for anything that 90 percent of the time isn’t being used. That’s one thing I have great hopes for, that whatever equipment we use will be more accessible and therefore more cleverly used.

Professionals
- what. They do
- why they don’t do it at home
- business opportunity for amateur chefs?
- compare blue apron
- maybe seek out a commercial test kitchen
