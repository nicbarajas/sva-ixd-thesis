summary: My setup, revisited

Some of these were things I learned as part of the process of [losing my shit][], some in the process of [getting distracted][] when I began my second semester.

- *Habits are difficult.* I should have made a go at using a replacement in a pretty stock configuration to see what I needed, but the cost of that was so high I did a much better job of wasting hours getting a restore done “properly,” inasmuch as a stupid three-week-old backup can be.
    But were a version of this to happen again, I’m already planning my escape. I’m taking this from the opposite of Christina—it’s time to begin my path down the KonMari method. More deliberate choices were things I began to think more strongly just before my bag grew legs—and now I have little excuse not to spend a minute reflecting over more of what I can absolutely do without.
- *Making my workflow device-agnostic is a huge win.* Friends, or at least classmates, know me as the iPad guy in the class. I avoided a full computer as much as I was able, to great success in some areas.
    And overall, it’s made me about 80% pleased with my early choice to have my thesis on GitHub. From a workflow perspective, re-establishing a means of adding posts and updating has literally meant me cramming my face into my iPhone—90% of what I’ve written lately has been with my two thumbs. (N.B., when it rains it pours: My screen developed a bright spot and I found myself at the Genius Bar this week to have the thing replaced.)

But it has highlighted other deficiencies with my current storytelling:

- I don’t usually have artwork in my posts, and having a smaller screen did not help;
- organizing files in this setup is a tedious affair, from draft to completion;
- my ideas to use Jekyll as a means of creating a greater organizational structure around tagging and projects has already hit the fan; and
- sketching went analog again. Not that this last part is much a problem, but it’s a trickier workflow to incorporate any image file that doesn’t live its life in an easy-to-reference place. (GitHub is pretty awful for images, I feel.)

Funny enough, it got me to write this meta piece I had planned for a while. A lot of the commentary in my mind

Meta: About my setup

Listening later on to an epsiode of [Back to Work](https://overcast.fm/+BZijXHPo "Back to Work: 252: The Chocolate Boys"), there are a couple of thing at play here. One of them is the idea of bringing stuff into one’s life as a talisman or avatar, that these objects reflect the intention of your life (not to get all *Fight Club* about it.) 

Even today, I do not miss the objects but the particular construction of what I carried and why—and that has made me still feel bereft.

But it has highlighted other deficiencies with my current storytelling:

- I don’t usually have artwork in my posts, and having a smaller screen did not help;
- organizing files in this setup is a tedious affair, from draft to completion;
- my ideas to use Jekyll as a means of creating a greater organizational structure around tagging and projects has already hit the fan; and
- sketching went analog again. Not that this last part is much a problem, but it’s a trickier workflow to incorporate any image file that doesn’t live its life in an easy-to-reference place. (GitHub is pretty awful for images, I feel.)
