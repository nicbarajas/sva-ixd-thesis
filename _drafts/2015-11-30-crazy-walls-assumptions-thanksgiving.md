title: "Assumptions, Crazy Walls, and Thanksgiving"
summary: "An assignment from class involved us thinking about all the assumptions of our topic area; meanwhile, I also did some in-situ testing over Thanksgiving break."

As the fall winds towards our final prototype of the semester, it’s worth looking back at a few ideas that have been locked up in my notes. A little ways back, we developed an assumption map—essentially, laying out the groundwork for our problem space so we can tackle it effectively. In the meantime, I also wanted to remind myself of some activities I’d performed personally that gave me more insight into potential user needs.

## Assumption Mapping

As part of our fall’s work, one of our thesis class sessions revolved around the creation of an assumption map. A lot of good things came out of building an assumption map with my classmates, primarily the scope of the field I’m interested. Cooking is such a large, unwieldy field, it’ll be worth focusing more on a particular area or smaller set of user needs.

### Assumptions

Some basic assumptions about cooking:

- Tools
-- Another assumption: the knowledge of how to use the tools
- Space
- Time
-- To prep
-- To cook
-- To eat
-- To clean
- Knowledge
-- Recipes
-- Techniques

Test against people with knowledge in the field

Coworking space—has it changed their habits?

Survey friend group: what keeps them from cooking?

Does cooking in bursts
Already has all the stuff
“I did all the things you’re supposed to do”
Get excited, novelty wears off
Effort is required (or appears to be required)
How to get people to continue

Burden of figuring out what to do
Laziness

Roommates?

**Ask how the experience differed**
How to separate what’s being tested
Needs to be clear what you’re testing
What results are meaningful

Answer whether the meal / ingredients are provided or not

Planned thing, give all the tools and step back to progress someone into being a self-sufficient home cook

Figure out what can be eliminated over time, is it equipment, ingredients, recipes?

How do you prevent the inevitable burnout? Once the novelty is gone

May have to narrow down audience—there is some implied knowledge about the ability to follow a recipe

Figure out the knowledge base of the consumer

In a group setting (?) what’s going to happen with various levels of skill?

Try a few experiments?
Tools / recipe / food
Tools / recipe
Tools / recipe idea

## Competitive Testing

In my personal life, I was trying out some of the competitive landscape around cooking and specifically meal delivery services. Late in the spring, I signed up for Blue Apron, mostly for the practicality (or convenience) of directly-delivered fresh groceries at a size just large enough for me to make meals for myself with some leftovers, or to share with a significant other.

Early this fall, I signed up for Hello Fresh at the suggestion of a friend, which I tried for a few weeks as a comparison. Hello Fresh is a more nicely presented package of individual meals, with all the pieces together, it felt a little more wasteful than Blue Apron, which has made significant efforts at efficiency with smaller boxes and smarter packaging.

I also got turned onto an article about [meal prep subscription boxes][wisebread], trying to look at their cost-effectiveness against each other. It brought a bunch more competitors to light for me, which provided a better lay of the land.

## Cooking with Family

Over the Thanksgiving break, I ended up cooking far more than usual as a part of testing out the various physical spaces of family members, along with their equipment.

One mistake I made in retrospect was not involving my family enough in the process. Most of the time, it was fairly solo work, but instead of seeing how they would cope with new ingredients or how they have accommodated themselves to their space, I took control of the situation to try to see how it would go.

Despite that, it wasn’t a completely one-person operation. At my parents’ house, at least, I managed to involve my mother in the project to help speed things up. What I noticed from that interaction was about being able to centralize preparatory space—because of some of the fixed equipment in the kitchen, my mother had to work in the dining room in order to get some thing ready, which in retrospect was kind of crazy.

The other obvious problem I encountered was around tools. It’s unclear to me how this happens, but in all three places I cooked—my aunt’s, my grandmother’s and my parents’—nobody had a decent knife. Surfaces on which to cut were also difficult to come by in most cases.

## Looking ahead

Ultimately, I think I need to create a physical manifestation of my thesis so far, as it feels like it’s leaking out of my brain.
