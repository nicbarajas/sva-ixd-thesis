Assumptions, Crazy Walls, and Thanksgiving” is me doing a little bit more synthesis on an assumption map that we built in the fall to help potentially organize my thoughts. Ultimately, I think I need to create a physical manifestation of my thesis so far, as it feels like it’s leaking out of my brain.

## Assumption Mapping

Dump from notes:

Another assumption: the knowledge of how to use the tools

Tools
Space
Time—time to prep, time to cook, time to eat, time to clean
Knowledge

Test against people with knowledge in the field

Coworking space—has it changed their habits?

Survey friend group: what keeps them from cooking?

Does cooking in bursts
Already has all the stuff
“I did all the things you’re supposed to do”
Get excited, novelty wears off
Effort is required (or appears to be required)
How to get people to continue

Burden of figuring out what to do
Laziness

Roommates?



**Ask how the experience differed**
How to separate what’s being tested
Needs to be clear what you’re testing
What results are meaningful

Answer whether the meal / ingredients are provided or not

Planned thing, give all the tools and step back to progress someone into being a self-sufficient home cook

Figure out what can be eliminated over time, is it equipment, ingredients, recipes?

How do you prevent the inevitable burnout? Once the novelty is gone

May have to narrow down audience—there is some implied knowledge about the ability to follow a recipe

Figure out the knowledge base of the consumer

In a group setting (?) what’s going to happen with various levels of skill?

Try a few experiments?
Tools / recipe / food
Tools / recipe
Tools / recipe idea



## Competitive Testing

Though the prototyping was not feeling successful, I was also trying out other aspects of cooking in my personal life. Late in the spring, I signed up for Blue Apron, mostly for the practicality (or convenience) of directly-delivered fresh groceries at a size just large enough for me to make meals for myself with some leftovers, or to share with a significant other.

Early this fall, I signed up for Hello Fresh at the suggestion of a friend, which I tried for a few weeks as a comparison.

Ultimately, while Hello Fresh is a more nicely presented package of individual meals, with all the pieces together, it felt a little more wasteful than Blue Apron, which has made significant efforts at efficiency with smaller boxes and smarter packaging.
