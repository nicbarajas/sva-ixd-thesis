summary: XOXO 2015 was an emotional, inspiring experience.
---

[XOXO][] is a very emotional festival. For all of its great joy and energy of the people in the conference, many of the inspiring stories from the speakers in the conference portion do not shield—in fact take great care to reveal—the difficulty of making their thing. Against the odds, other people, and sometimes themselves as well, they put these great ideas into the world.

As part of the conference, [Nicky Case][] talked a lot about chaos theory and the inability to know what small decisions one makes that may affect their lives in truly profound ways. In his case, how small, independent side work derailed him from his crowdfunded project, and how it even cause him to abandon it entirely.

At one point, he suggested you kill your dream—that up close and in person, it doesn’t necessarily look like what you thought it did when it was a figment.

But owing to chaos theory, you don’t have one dream. You may have many—and even in the context of my thesis, the ideas are bountiful and perhaps even at the scale of too many possibilities. So to that end, his suggestion was maybe not to kill your dreams, but serial kill them.

The idea: leave yourself as open as possible for whatever happens. Those connections you end up making may trace themselves back in a manner you couldn’t have imagined. And planning that precious dream takes your mind off from the doing that’s so important.
