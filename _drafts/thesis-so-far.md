Title: Thesis, So Far
---

I have been pretty lax on my progress for thesis. It’s been from a few things—[XOXO][] was one of them, but also a slow adjustment to the rapid pace of school and work.

Another thing has been my choice of platform: I have been resolute on trying to find a method that I can update from anywhere, and have been feeling my way out on the best method across various devices. *(N.B., this is being written on an iPhone.)*

In any case, all these excuses mean I have some ground to make up.

## How’s thesis?

It’s quite the adventure right now. As I have described to enough people who have had the misfortune to run into me, my problem is not that I have no ideas for thesis, rather that there are so many ideas it’s difficult to even get them aligned.

They tend to be concentrated in some key areas, mostly around my projects from the last year, and of course my work and what I spend my free time doing or thinking about.

It’s a bad idea in general to do those things, I feel; it relegated you to making work out of passion projects, or designing for yourself. But I have a long road ahead of me, and there is time to refine it into something that helps a wider audience.

## Best and Brightest

My top ideas largely concentrate in the areas of highest concern for me personally, but it’s not all that way. Here are a smattering:

* TKTK

## Random and Miscellaneous

I throw a lot of things into a litany of miscellaneous note-taking tools, so even those most “polished” of ideas don’t encompass it all. Here are some of the remainders of my provocations:

* **Gun violence** is destroying communities, a true source of terror to the nation. What could be done from a design perspective to help assist communities, help take back power and help prevent another catastrophe?
* **Lifestream**—a more private way to aggregate the disparate data of your life, possibly using the archives / backup of the services themselves. Is there a way to make something that provides a more responsive—and responsible—means of keeping your data for the long term?
* **Ecology** and improving **repair and recycling**: we currently do too much blind throwing out of material that could be recycled or repaired but without much insight into how that could be done. Is ther a way to better inform the public about means of reuse and repair?
