title: "Creating a Tiny Kitchen"
summary: "Delivered as the final of the fall semester, it was ultimately not very successful at drawing in new people, but I made a great meal with it."

A twisted road followed my [first prototype][prototype-one], as I tried to reflect on what worked about the experience and put it through more refinement and pick a better sense of scope.

[prototype-one]: http://nicbarajas.github.io/sva-ixd-thesis/2015/11/15/first-prototype-learnings-results/

This involved a few dead ends, mainly at the hands of time and ability to execute.

## Pivots and Panics

I started thinking more about the hungry when it came to food, and thought a lot about what utility I could provide for them. I went down a bit of a rabbit hole of trying to understand what could be done about mobile power or a portable food setup without really considering whether it needed to be real, what could be faked, or what my goals were. For example, I investigated the [rules and regulations](http://www.nycgovparks.org/rules) of the NYC Parks system and found how I could get by them, but didn’t have an actual plan for what I was going to be doing.

This ended up being the kind of distraction that hurt me. Even though it felt important thing to solve, I was under-equipped to do so, particularly considering my time constraints. I hesitated to contact folks who worked at non-profits who helped the hungry because I know I would be challenged to find time to meet with them, and didn’t get around quickly enough to having another thing to test.

In a conversation with a classmate, it was made clearer to me that while it may be altruistic, feeding the hungry was a solve problem (insomuch as the tools go—perhaps the interaction design is still not strong) and that I may have used the hungry as essentially a red herring for what I actually had the ability to solve in my timeframe.

My waffling drained most of my time, so I finally ended on a twist on my first prototype. It gave a tiny, physical presence to the cooking tools and some suggestions, along with iteration to try to build a means of helping through Slack.

## The How of Prototype Two

In gathering materials for a tiny physical space, about 5.5 cubic feet in space, I hoped it would be enough to see what the challenges are in working on a meal. It was really just a tweak of the first prototype—establishing a more secure space to allow cooking experiments happen in the studio.

It came together pretty quickly when I finally put it all together. I built the stand, rearranged the tools and purchased the gift cards, and waited. … and waited.

### Attempting to Test, and Self-Testing Exercises

I offered a generous sum to participate in the form of $25 gift cards, which I pre-purchased for participants. I figured it could either be used as a grocery stipend or a nice supplement for those willing to participate.

I also tried creating a little bit of informational material. Using Pages, I made a little flyer that I put above the stand explaining the point of the exercise, and tried to drum up interest in our internal Slack.

After I made that initial call, and found participants wanting, I leaned back on my own play testing again. I looked up a [fairly easy dish](http://www.marthastewart.com/316032/chicken-with-tomatoes-and-mushrooms), then captured an ingredient list and took off for Trader Joe’s late on a weekend evening. I shopped, got the necessary ingredients, and came back to put together what was a fairly impressive meal for the tiny space.

In that play testing a few obvious things came up. Water and keeping things clean was the most challenging part of the experiment. Since I set up the space far from a traditional kitchen space, it made cleaning in between impossible. I tried using additional prep bowls as interim disposal, but keeping hands clean is incredibly difficult without a close source of running water.

I also cheated at the plating portion of the experiment, since I just did not have anywhere near enough room for that part of the process. I ended up having some classmates who tried out my creation and were impressed with the quality of the meal that came out of that space.

After my personal success there, I decided a more central place to discuss this sort of thing could drum up interest, so I created a Slack channel, which I named #tinykitchen (based off an old Times video series I loved), and provided a little more context for the project.

Still, there were no additional takers, and it came down after the semester ended.

## Reflection

What worked about the prototype:

- Again, it cannot be overstated that this was a real thing people could use and experience directly. For something like cooking, I cannot imagine trying to test things that affect cooking without an environment where one actually makes a meal.

What didn’t work:

- It was still stuck in the studio. It would have been great to see how this would have fared with a more random crowd or a more public venue.
- Bad timing. End of the semester, with finals looming overhead for others? No incentive seemed to matter—I could not get a participant.
- The signage for the prototype didn’t feel very well considered, some mentioned. Though I thought about what might be helpful for potential users, it was not built as an enticing call to action, but more as an instruction manual.

My fall ended on a middling note, but it was encouraging to think about how I could take the ideas of the fall and begin anew in the spring as I home in on a clearer direction for my project.
