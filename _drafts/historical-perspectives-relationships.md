title: Tracing Relationships Back in Time
summary: Our modern world isn’t so interesting when it comes to relationships.
---

As part of my continued exploration of [thesis][thesis-1], one of our assignments is to look at a thesis idea from a historical perspective—go to back earlier than products, all the way back to the original social constructs that deal with your idea.

It would have been a convenient—perhaps even fun?—challenge to do Beerio, considering it has such ancient origins, but in reality the way that individuals related to each other is the most original human component. And as I panicked in the [“Endless House” exhibition][moma] at the Museum of Modern Art, part of my realization was that I want to try to find a project that can provide meaningful impact, not necessarily make a more convenient product.

From the original prompt:

> Trace back your thesis idea as far back in product design as you can. If possible, think before products, before technology, into as far past into human evolution as you can.

Which means I won’t even need to consider apps like Tinder or OK Cupid, and end up considering pespectives even before the construct of marriage. (We also had a separate prompt, called Powers of Ten, that dovetails here nicely.) It may be heavy, heady, and probably is a mix of both, but is useful in re-orienting an intervention from a modern convenience to a proper course correction.

##  An attempt to not mansplain the history of human interaction

Let’s do some research.

Deep in a Wikipedia hole (a service which is never wrong), you can end up getting lost in the ideas of [arranged marriages][],  which actually does a great deal to profess society’s influence on courtship, and of course, the greater predilection of societies towards marriage and how marriage is seen as a [cultural universal][] (despite its reliance on a body that can bestow and respect marriage).

Going back to the dawn of human existence, where societies didn’t exist to anoint coupling, my assumption (not really being borne out of anything, since this would be pre-historical) 

But I kinda want to get away from marriage as a defining characteristic of courtship for lots of reasons, not least of which because marriage as a requirement for intimacy and courtship generally upholds patriarchal and unbalanced views of how people should act, and makes it difficult to give

## … and Powers of Ten

As I described above, another assignment asked us to consider our thesis idea in relation to a couple of different factors: either ideation- or insight-driven perspectives in the guise of [Powers of Ten][] the classic Eames video about the sense of scale in a logarithmic sense.
