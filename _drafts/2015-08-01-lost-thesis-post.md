title: Thesis Diary, Intro
summary: "A lost post from over the summer about where my head was at about thesis."

Trying to get things written down in a way where I can reference them later. It eventually will work its way back to why I am making a thing at all.

Chatted with Boris a few weeks ago (4/17) about his ideas for helping with research for how people can tell better stories. Or at least that’s how I interpreted it.

Right now, my broad area of concern is storytelling, and how there can be effective platforms for people to do that with clarity and comfort. In some manners, all we create are ways to tell stories and the means through which to communicate them to people.

The first is natural, that desire to record and keep; the second invented and derivative of the first because of distances the separate us—the gaps in the story that make for alternative interpretations.

I’m interested to see at which scale I can provide meaning and value. I don’t necessarily need to intervene at the story creation level if somewhere else makes me a more vital participant.
