The idea of independent utility with approachable design is pretty cool.

My project is meant to better understand food and cooking, an incredibly important activity for people. I’m stuck at a crossroads with two different ideas in mind: One focuses on the home chef, while the other looks to the independent (or hopeful independent) professional in the industry. For our home chef, the goal is understanding her process for cooking—looking at everything from planning and prep all the way through the cooking process to cleanup—in order to take away some of the friction and help her create a meal experience she enjoys and does more often. For the professional, it’s vital to discover the hurdles she faces when trying to establish this new venture, whether that’s in securing space to create, finding ways to sell, or connecting with a community for support, so she can be empowered to follow her own vision and focus on the appropriate experiences.

Picking one of these directions is the first hurdle I’d like to clear with the help of an advisor, but I’m not looking for someone to make decisions for me—my hope is conversation with an advisor will ignite the creative process, help critique and push me to create. My ideal advisor:

- Has experience in the industry, either as a cook, a partner in a food venture, or has worked at a food-related startup
- Hopefully enjoys cooking, but even if she hates it can articulate why
- Understands the current landscape of the food industry

I’m putting more thoughts together in a thesis journal; my latest post provides an executive summary of the fall, and I’m working on longer posts that flesh the process out.

If this sounds like an interesting opportunity, my email address is nbarajas@sva.edu; keep Eric Forman <eric@ericforman.com> copied so we can coordinate appropriately.

Thanks for your time and attention. Looking forward to making a connection.

The details:

Generally, advisors are required to spend about an hour or so a week to meet with me and help me in my process, along with attending a thesis defense in early May. It’s not a huge commitment—these weekly meetings are meant to help critique and provide an additional perspective on the project—and pays an honorarium of $1000.

An advisor’s role is to support, help organize and suggest ways to move along the project, be critical and advocate, provide subject-matter expertise and also help connect to people, things or other ideas.
