title: Research Plan: Community Space
summary: Coming up with ideas for an experimental community place.

A feeling that keeps waving over me, as I go through both the streets of the city as well as those of small communities (at least in America), is that we’ve got a ton of space that we’re willing to do nothing with for way too long. And at the same time, not enough publicly facing space that allows people to experiement without getting overly invested.

If we know that half of all businesses fail to survive past five years, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics (via the [U.S. Small Business Administration][sba]), what tools could be given to burgeoning entrepreneurs without requiring huge fixed costs like rent and labor?

## Here to date

Originally, I’d been calling this a public space project, which was confusing, because the name evokes the use of publicly owned space like parks, or [privately owned public spaces][pops], of which my idea is neither.

Instead, the idea is to make private space actually owned by the public in a more meaningful way. POPS don’t seem to fit the bill because they are meant for the public to enjoy, but not for their improvement.
