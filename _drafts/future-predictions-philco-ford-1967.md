Future-vision videos like [1999 A.D.][] are a certain kind of catnip to me. I love their far-flung ideas, some of which are naïvely early for their time, others of which . And no matter what, they are always rooted in the design and function of the present-day. From the opening shot, with the clothing, to the pan back to the dome-topped car with wings, is such a late-60s thing to have designed. Everything has that modern vibe to it, which I love because any of these videos instantly become a product of their time.

One of the things that seems most bizarre to me is the education center. A bored kid in a turtleneck sitting in a modern chair, who couldn’t care less about the video he’s watching. At least they’re using Helvetica for the type on the viewer. But why it feels bizarre isn’t the odd-looking room—rather, it’s the lack of actual in-person human interaction. It ends up more true than we may like to admit for many tasks, where one sees oneself in the reflection of a screen (or three), but in the case of education the classroom still feels like a vital component—where are the other people in the world?

Other notes: The shift to the woman as home-maker, a classic sexist trope, with her boys asking her to make lunch; 

I love this quote:

“All part of the instant society of tomorrow; a society rich in leisure and taken-for-granted comforts.”

How prescient that quote is, even if it was talking about flash-frozen food instead of the actual writ-large changes to the makeup of how the haves
