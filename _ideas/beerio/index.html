title: Beerio 2.0
status: In Analysis
---

Beerio has been my baby. It’s been an idea I have had rolling around in my head for more than five years, and I have been making inroads towards a great solution for the last couple. In the last year alone, I have spent my time refining my pitch on Beerio, putting it out in the world as a concept, and creating a Kickstarter campaign to fund a web app.

It’s been the project that I have cared about second only to my day job, and something I have yet to see another company do well. My vision has long been to have a private journal with the power of the Internet, an ability to find beers nearby but keep for myself what I thought of it in a quick, convenient package.

## Credentials

This product has been under some level of nearly active development since last fall, when it was a part of my Strategic Innovation class. I refined the vision a bit in the spring, and used Kickstarter and my Entreprenurial Design course to try to bring a version of it to fruition.

## Need

I think for anything as frivolous as a craft beer journaling app, need is a strong word. That said, many of the existing apps and networks are expecting a couple of things: gratuitious sharing and a constant pipe to the web. Anyone who has truly spent any time in bars might feel a little differently about both.

Therefore, there's not a traditionally expressed need for this app, but I think it's a certain nice-to-have app, and with a superb experience, it could potentially rival better-placed apps.

### Pros

- Have a fair amount of experience already trying to work on this product
- Built-in user base. Many people have already expressed interest in the product, even in the basic state I pitched it through Kickstarter.

### Cons

- Filled with monied or long-known competition. The major players in this arena have either a deep history, or at least venture capital. Those resources make it difficult to compete in a niche.
