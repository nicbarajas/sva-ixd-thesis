title: Publishing and the Journalism Industry
status: In Analysis
---

For this thesis idea, my focus has been on the industry and workflows I know best: journalism and publishing. In particular, I have been thinking about what makes for more efficient workflows, particularly around the composing environment.

That said, there is much that the industry could use. I have a vested interest in the next generation of journalists, and what they could use. Student journalists are those who have

## Credentials

I’m not lacking for expertise here, with several years of work at my day job at The New York Times. In addition, the Times has for more than a decade provided opportunities to underprivileged college students through its New York Times Student Journalism Institute. I attended the program in 2008, and was fortunate enough to be a mentor for the program.

In addition, my connection to my alma mater’s paper, _The Ithacan_, is strong. During my time as a student, I was able to work in positions across the organization, from print to digital, and in years hence have been open to reconnecting.

## Need

Student journalists deserve better training, resources and insight than they currently get. As local news organizations shrink, the ability for the campus news organization to provide critical feedback to its community becomes more important. Moreover, college campuses are the few places where even traditional news organizations have little ability to turn a critical eye, even if finances were secure. Therefore, it is more incumbent on the student press to hold their schools accountable.

Digital tools for creation of content are pentiful but not necessarily easy. Increasingly, people are reliant on cumbersome content management systems, or worse, outsourcing the means of production to a third-party platform.

There is nothing inherently wrong with experimenting with third-party platforms. Medium is an incredible platform, and the ability to connect on large social networks like Facebook, Twitter, etc., are all excellent. That said, the most important thing any journalist should keep in mind is the ability to control one’s own presses, as it were, from any undue influence.

### Pros

- Stated need is great
- Good mission
- 

### Cons

- It’s a crowded space. Tools are not at issue here. Even at the Times, we are trying to investigate the next generation of storytelling.
- Composing tools tend to be purpose-made and -built. Most general-purpose tools are actually not as useful for journalists, even if it intends to reach a journalistic audience.
