# SVA IXD Master’s Thesis

This is the home for the thesis of Nic Barajas, an MFA candidate in the School of Visual Arts’ Interaction Design program.

The hope is with a public repository of all the notes and work that are done for the thesis project, it provides a working model for others who may be interested in designing in public, or at least provides entertainment.
